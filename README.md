[![Model Context Protocol](https://img.shields.io/badge/MCP-Compatible-blue.svg)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)

## ✨ What It Does

Turn any AI assistant into a senior developer with **TRUE COLLABORATIVE INTELLIGENCE**:
- **🧠 Learn from Success** - Store and share successful implementation patterns
- **📋 Smart Planning** - Generate PRPs enhanced with community knowledge
- **🔄 Collaborative Learning** - Each successful project teaches the next developer
- **⚡ Universal Compatibility** - Works with Cursor, Claude Desktop, VS Code, and more

**The Revolutionary Difference:** Instead of starting from scratch every time, your AI assistant learns from every successful implementation in the community!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install
```bash
npm install -g mcp-context-engineering
```

### 2. Setup
```bash
# Setup MongoDB database (non-interactive, uses environment variables)
mcp-context-engineering setup-database

# Initialize with REAL Context Engineering templates
mcp-context-engineering generate-sample-data
```

**Environment Variables Required:**
- `MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING` - Your MongoDB connection string
- `MDB_MCP_OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key for embeddings

### 3. Configure Your AI Assistant
Add to your MCP settings:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context-engineering": {
      "command": "mcp-context-engineering",
      "env": {
        "MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING": "your-mongodb-uri",
        "MDB_MCP_OPENAI_API_KEY": "your-openai-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Trigger Context Research
Use these **trigger phrases** to activate the MongoDB intelligence:

```
"Help me build [feature] using MongoDB Context Engineering"
"Research patterns for [feature] using context-research"
"Generate a PRP for [feature] using context-assemble-prp"
"Build [feature] with context engineering patterns"
"I need help with [feature] using proven patterns"
```



**Important:** You must mention **"MongoDB Context Engineering"** or the specific tool names for the AI to call the MCP tools.

Your AI assistant will:
1. 🔍 Call `context-research` → Get MongoDB patterns + research guidance
2. 📊 Follow research instructions → Search your codebase and web
3. 📋 Call `context-assemble-prp` → Generate comprehensive implementation guide
4. ⚡ Implement with validation loops
5. 📊 **Call capture tools** → Store successful outputs for community learning

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Context Research** - Search MongoDB for proven patterns with real success rates
- **Smart Assembly** - Generate comprehensive PRPs enhanced with community knowledge
- **Output Capture** - Store successful PRPs, patterns, and gotchas for community learning
- **Collaborative Intelligence** - Each success teaches the next developer
- **Success Scoring** - Confidence ratings based on real implementation data
- **Universal Rules** - Consistent patterns across all AI assistants

## 🔄 The Collaborative Intelligence Loop

**Traditional Context Engineering:** Each project starts from scratch
**MongoDB Context Engineering:** Each success builds community intelligence

1. **Generate PRP** → Enhanced with community patterns
2. **Implement Successfully** → Validation loops ensure quality
3. **Capture Outputs** → Store successful patterns, gotchas, approaches
4. **Share Intelligence** → Next developer benefits from your success
5. **Continuous Learning** → Platform gets smarter with every use

## ⚠️ Important Usage Notes

**Context is NOT updated automatically!** You must:
- Use trigger phrases like "MongoDB Context Engineering"
- Mention specific tool names: `context-research` or `context-assemble-prp`
- The AI assistant calls the tools only when explicitly triggered

**If the AI doesn't call the tools:**
- Check your trigger phrase includes "MongoDB Context Engineering"
- Verify MCP configuration is correct
- Restart your AI assistant after configuration changes

- **[Templates](templates/)** - Project setup templates

## 🌟 Why It's Revolutionary

**Before:** Manual research, static templates, individual knowledge  
**After:** Instant intelligence, collaborative patterns, predictable success

Perfect for developers who want their AI assistants to work like senior developers with access to community knowledge.
