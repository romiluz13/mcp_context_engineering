# üöÄ MCP Context Engineering - CORRECT WORKFLOW

## ‚ùå WRONG: What You've Been Trying
```bash
# User runs CLI directly:
$ mcp-context-engineering generate-prp "build auth system"
# Result: Empty PRP with no real research

$ mcp-context-engineering execute-prp PRPs/auth.md
# Result: No code exists, all tests fail
```

## ‚úÖ CORRECT: How It Should Work

### Step 1: Configure MCP in Your AI Assistant

**For Cursor:**
```json
// .cursor/mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context-engineering": {
      "command": "mcp-context-engineering",
      "env": {
        "MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
        "MDB_MCP_OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For Claude Desktop:**
```json
// ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/config.json (Mac)
// %APPDATA%\Claude\config.json (Windows)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context-engineering": {
      "command": "mcp-context-engineering",
      "env": {
        "MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
        "MDB_MCP_OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Use Trigger Phrases

**CRITICAL:** Context is NOT automatic! Use these exact trigger phrases:

‚úÖ **CORRECT Trigger Phrases:**
- "Help me build [feature] using MongoDB Context Engineering"
- "Research patterns for [feature] using context-research"
- "Generate a PRP for [feature] using context-assemble-prp"
- "Use MongoDB Context Engineering to implement [feature]"

‚ùå **WRONG (Won't trigger tools):**
- "Help me build authentication" (missing trigger)
- "Build a login system" (no MCP mention)
- "Create user management" (won't call tools)

### Step 3: AI Conversation Example

**You:** Help me build a user authentication system using MongoDB Context Engineering

**AI Assistant:** I'll help you build a user authentication system using the MongoDB Context Engineering workflow. Let me start by researching proven patterns and best practices.

*[AI calls context-research tool]*

Now let me search your codebase for existing authentication patterns and conventions...

*[AI searches your actual code files]*

Let me also find the latest documentation and best practices online...

*[AI searches web for auth libraries, security guides, etc.]*

Now I'll assemble all this research into a comprehensive implementation plan...

*[AI calls context-assemble-prp tool with combined research]*

Great! I've created a comprehensive PRP (Project Requirements and Patterns) document. Now let me implement this step by step:

1. **Setting up the authentication module**
   *[AI creates auth module files]*

2. **Implementing password hashing**
   *[AI implements bcrypt integration]*

3. **Creating login/register endpoints**
   *[AI creates API endpoints]*

4. **Adding validation and error handling**
   *[AI adds comprehensive validation]*

5. **Writing tests**
   *[AI creates test suite]*

6. **Running validation loops**
   ```bash
   npm test  # All tests pass!
   npm run lint  # Code is clean!
   ```

**You:** Perfect! The authentication system works great!

## üéØ Key Differences

### Original Claude Desktop Workflow
- **Commands**: `/generate-prp` and `/execute-prp`
- **Actor**: Claude AI does everything
- **Access**: Claude has full codebase and web access
- **Result**: Complete working implementation

### MCP Context Engineering Workflow
- **Tools**: `context-research` and `context-assemble-prp`
- **Actor**: ANY AI assistant (Cursor, Claude, etc.)
- **Access**: AI uses its own capabilities + MongoDB intelligence
- **Result**: Same complete implementation, but universal!

## üìã What Each Component Does

### MCP Tools (Called by AI)
1. **context-research**: Searches MongoDB for YOUR personal patterns and provides research methodology
2. **context-assemble-prp**: Generates comprehensive implementation plans with project constitution
3. **memory-bank-***: Manages persistent context across sessions

### CLI Commands (For Setup/Maintenance)
1. **setup-database**: Creates MongoDB collections and indexes
2. **generate-sample-data**: Populates initial patterns and knowledge
3. **create-feature**: Helper to create feature request files

### What the AI Does (30+ Minute Research Methodology)
1. **Calls MCP tools** for personal pattern intelligence and research guidance
2. **Searches YOUR codebase** for existing patterns and implementations
3. **Searches the web** for documentation, examples, and best practices
4. **Performs ULTRATHINK** phase for comprehensive planning
5. **Implements the actual code** following generated PRP
6. **Runs validation loops** and fixes issues iteratively
7. **Updates memory bank** with successful patterns for future use

### Project Constitution (NEW!)
- **Reads project rules** from `.cursorrules`, `mcp_rules.md`, or `CLAUDE.md`
- **Enforces constraints** like file length limits, testing standards
- **Ensures consistency** across all implementations in the project

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Don't run generate-prp.js directly** - It can't access your code or the web

‚ùå **Don't run execute-prp.js directly** - It can't implement code

‚ùå **Don't expect CLI scripts to do the AI's job** - They're just tools

‚úÖ **Do configure MCP in your AI assistant** - This is the correct integration

‚úÖ **Do let the AI orchestrate everything** - It has the capabilities needed

‚úÖ **Do use the workflow through natural conversation** - Not CLI commands

## üéâ The Magic of MCP

The beauty of MCP (Model Context Protocol) is that it makes the MongoDB Context Engineering intelligence available to ANY AI assistant, not just Claude Desktop.

**ROLE CLARITY:**
- **MCP Server**: Stores/retrieves your personal patterns in MongoDB, provides research methodology, enforces project constitution
- **AI Assistant**: Does the actual 30+ minute research, codebase analysis, web search, ULTRATHINK, implementation, and testing
- **Result**: Original Context Engineering methodology enhanced with persistent memory and personal pattern learning

This is why the CLI scripts can't work standalone - they're missing the AI's research and implementation capabilities!
