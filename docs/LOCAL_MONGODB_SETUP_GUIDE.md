# 🚀 Context Engineering Local MongoDB Setup Guide

## 🎯 What We Just Set Up

We've created a **LOCAL MongoDB instance** for your Context Engineering system that will store all your:
- 📚 Project memory banks (persistent context across AI sessions)
- 🧩 Implementation patterns (what worked)
- ⚠️ Discovered gotchas (what to avoid)
- 📋 PRPs (Project Requirements and Patterns)
- 🤝 Collaborative intelligence (shared patterns)

## 🔧 Setup Summary

### 1. **Local MongoDB Database**
- **Database Name:** `context_engineering`
- **Connection:** `mongodb://localhost:27017/context_engineering`
- **Collections Created:** 9 specialized collections
- **Indexes:** Optimized for fast searches

### 2. **MCP Configuration**
- **Location:** `~/.config/mcp/mcp.json`
- **Command:** `mcp-context-engineering` (uses global npm installation)
- **Environment Variables:** MongoDB connection + OpenAI API key

## ⚙️ Required: Add Your OpenAI API Key

You need to edit the MCP configuration file to add your OpenAI API key:

```bash
# Open the configuration file
open ~/.config/mcp/mcp.json
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key-here"` with your actual OpenAI API key:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-context-engineering": {
      "command": "mcp-context-engineering",
      "env": {
        "MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING": "mongodb://localhost:27017/context_engineering",
        "MDB_MCP_OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-..." // <- Your actual key here
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔄 After Setup: Restart Cursor

**IMPORTANT:** After adding your API key, you must restart Cursor for the changes to take effect:

1. Save the `mcp.json` file
2. Completely quit Cursor (Cmd+Q on Mac)
3. Start Cursor again
4. The MCP server will now connect to your local MongoDB

## 🧠 How Memory Banks Work

### Initialize a Project Memory Bank
When starting a new project or wanting to save context:

```
Use the tool: memory-bank-initialize
- project_name: "my-awesome-project"
- project_brief: "Building a React app with TypeScript"
- technology_stack: ["react", "typescript", "mongodb"]
```

### Update Memory Bank
After making progress or discovering patterns:

```
Use the tool: memory-bank-update
- project_name: "my-awesome-project"
- update_type: "progress"
- changes_made: "Implemented authentication system"
- learnings: ["Use JWT for stateless auth", "bcrypt for password hashing"]
```

### Read Memory Bank (New Session)
When starting a new chat session:

```
Use the tool: memory-bank-read
- project_name: "my-awesome-project"
```

This loads ALL your project context, eliminating the need to re-explain everything!

## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

**Before Context Engineering:**
- 😫 Every new chat = explaining project from scratch
- 📝 Manual context files like `FULL_CONTEXT_FOR_NEW_CHAT_SESSION.md`
- 🔄 Repeating the same information over and over
- 🧩 Lost patterns and learnings between sessions

**With Context Engineering:**
- 🧠 Persistent memory across ALL chat sessions
- 🚀 Instant context loading with one command
- 📈 Patterns improve over time (collaborative intelligence)
- 🎯 AI understands your project immediately

## 🔍 Verify Everything is Working

After restarting Cursor with your OpenAI API key:

1. **Check Health:**
   ```
   Use tool: health-check (with detailed: true)
   ```
   Should show:
   - ✅ MongoDB Connection: connected
   - ✅ OpenAI Client: initialized

2. **Initialize Your First Memory Bank:**
   ```
   Use tool: memory-bank-initialize
   - project_name: "mcp-context-engineering"
   - project_brief: "The Context Engineering MCP server itself"
   - technology_stack: ["typescript", "mongodb", "mcp"]
   ```

3. **Test Memory Bank Read:**
   ```
   Use tool: memory-bank-read
   - project_name: "mcp-context-engineering"
   ```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "MongoDB client not initialized"
**Solution:** Add your OpenAI API key to `~/.config/mcp/mcp.json` and restart Cursor

### Issue: "Command not found: mcp-context-engineering"
**Solution:** Make sure you have it installed globally:
```bash
npm install -g mcp-context-engineering
```

### Issue: MongoDB not running
**Solution:** Start MongoDB:
```bash
brew services start mongodb-community
```

### Issue: Can't find memory bank
**Solution:** Memory banks are project-specific. Use exact project name you initialized with.

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Your Context Engineering system is now:
- ✅ Using LOCAL MongoDB (no cloud dependencies)
- ✅ Configured for Cursor MCP
- ✅ Ready to store persistent context
- ✅ Able to share patterns between projects

**Next step:** Add your OpenAI API key and restart Cursor to start using your innovative memory bank system!

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **One Memory Bank Per Project:** Each project gets its own memory bank
2. **Regular Updates:** Update memory bank after significant changes
3. **Context Focus:** Use `context_focus` parameter when reading to get specific info
4. **Pattern Capture:** When something works well, capture it as a pattern
5. **Gotcha Documentation:** When you hit issues, document them as gotchas

Remember: This solves the exact problem you were having - no more manual context transfer between chat sessions!
