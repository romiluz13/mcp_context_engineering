# ðŸ§  MEMORY BANK ENHANCEMENT PLAN (WORLD-CLASS, AI-OPTIMIZED)

## Context & Rationale

This plan is the result of a deep-dive analysis of:
- Our current MongoDB-native MCP memory bank
- [ipenywis/aimemory](https://github.com/ipenywis/aimemory)
- [alioshr/memory-bank-mcp](https://github.com/alioshr/memory-bank-mcp)
- Advanced context engineering and AI context window best practices

**Goal:**
> Create the most context-efficient, AI-usable, and smart memory bank in the worldâ€”storing only the most relevant, high-signal data for AI coding and context engineering, with every field and structure justified for maximum value.

---

## 1. Principles for a World-Class Memory Bank

- **Context Density:** Every field must maximize information per token. Use summaries, references, and links instead of raw dumps.
- **Prioritization:** Recent, high-impact, and frequently accessed data is surfaced first.
- **AI-Optimized Access:** Fast lookup for active tasks, blockers, user goals, and critical patterns.
- **Context Window Management:** Use short summaries, AI-generated digests, and links to full docs to avoid bloat.
- **Expiry/Archiving:** Stale or low-value data is archived or summarized to keep the active context lean.
- **Semantic Structure:** Use objects/arrays for grouping, and keep all fields semantically meaningful.
- **Minimal Redundancy:** No duplicate data; reference instead of repeat.

---

## 2. Improved Field-by-Field Design

### **files** (Object)
- **projectOverview** (String, â‰¤ 500 chars):
  - *Purpose:* One-paragraph summary of the project, updated as the project evolves.
  - *Best Practice:* AI-generated, human-reviewed. Should answer: What is this? Who is it for? Why does it matter?
- **userExperienceGoals** (String, â‰¤ 300 chars):
  - *Purpose:* Top 3-5 user experience goals, prioritized by impact.
  - *Best Practice:* Bullet list or short sentences. Only the most important goals.
- **architecture** (Object):
  - *Purpose:* Dense summary of system design, with references to diagrams or docs.
  - *Structure:* `{ summary: String, diagramLinks: [String], keyDecisions: [String] }`
  - *Best Practice:* Use links to full diagrams/docs, not inline images or code.
- **components** (Array of Objects):
  - *Purpose:* List of major components, each with a 1-2 sentence summary and status.
  - *Structure:* `[ { name: String, summary: String, status: String } ]`
  - *Best Practice:* Only include components relevant to current/active work.
- **developmentProcess** (String, â‰¤ 300 chars):
  - *Purpose:* Key workflow/process notes, conventions, and CI/CD details.
  - *Best Practice:* Summarize, link to full docs if needed.
- **apiDocumentation** (Object):
  - *Purpose:* Dense summary of API contracts, with links to schemas/endpoints.
  - *Structure:* `{ summary: String, endpointLinks: [String] }`
- **progressLog** (Array of Objects, rolling window):
  - *Purpose:* Chronological log of major milestones, blockers, and next steps.
  - *Structure:* `[ { date: Date, summary: String, type: 'milestone'|'blocker'|'next' } ]`
  - *Best Practice:* Only keep the last N (e.g., 10) entries in active context; archive older entries.
- **activeContext** (Object):
  - *Purpose:* What is being worked on right now, by whom, and why.
  - *Structure:* `{ focus: String, assignedTo: [String], startedAt: Date, urgency: String }`
- **knownIssues** (Array of Objects):
  - *Purpose:* List of current blockers/bugs, each with status and workaround (if any).
  - *Structure:* `[ { issue: String, status: String, workaround: String, lastUpdated: Date } ]`

### **patterns** (Object)
- **implementation** (Array of Objects):
  - *Purpose:* Proven, high-signal implementation patterns, each with a summary, success metric, and reference.
  - *Structure:* `[ { name: String, summary: String, successRate: Number, reference: String } ]`
  - *Best Practice:* Only include patterns with >70% success rate or high relevance.
- **gotchas** (Array of Objects):
  - *Purpose:* Known pitfalls, edge cases, and their mitigations.
  - *Structure:* `[ { description: String, mitigation: String, reference: String } ]`
- **validation** (Array of Objects):
  - *Purpose:* Test strategies, validation approaches, and their results.
  - *Structure:* `[ { type: String, summary: String, lastRun: Date, result: String } ]`

### **notes** (Array of Objects, rolling window):
- *Purpose:* Ad-hoc, high-signal learnings, decisions, or context not captured elsewhere.
- *Structure:* `[ { date: Date, note: String, relevance: String } ]`
- *Best Practice:* Only keep recent/high-relevance notes in active context.

### **config** (Object)
- *Purpose:* Versioning, event triggers, real-time features, and context expiry policies.
- *Structure:* `{ memory_bank_version: String, real_time_features: Object, expiryPolicy: Object }`
- *Best Practice:* Use expiryPolicy to auto-archive stale data.

### **success_metrics** (Object)
- *Purpose:* Track PRP generation, implementation success, confidence scores, and usage stats.
- *Structure:* `{ prps_generated: Number, implementations_successful: Number, confidence_scores: [Number], average_confidence: Number, usageStats: Object }`
- *Best Practice:* Use for context prioritization (e.g., surface most successful patterns).

### **collaborative_intelligence** (Object)
- *Purpose:* Store and sync community patterns, sync history, and shared learnings.
- *Structure:* `{ community_patterns: [Object], sync_history: Object, lastSync: Date }`
- *Best Practice:* Only sync/share high-confidence, high-impact patterns.

---

## 3. Context Prioritization & Window Optimization

- **Recency:** Most recent and active items are surfaced first.
- **Importance:** Use `urgency`, `relevance`, and `successRate` fields to prioritize.
- **Frequency of Access:** Track and surface most-accessed patterns/components.
- **Summarization:** Use AI-generated digests for long fields; link to full docs.
- **Rolling Windows:** For logs/notes, only keep the last N entries in active context.
- **References/Links:** Use links to full docs, diagrams, or code for deep dives.

---

## 4. Context Expiry & Archiving

- **Expiry Policy:** Define in `config.expiryPolicy` (e.g., archive progressLog entries older than 30 days).
- **Archiving:** Move stale/low-value data to an `archive` collection or field.
- **Summarization:** For archived data, keep only a short summary and a link/reference.

---

## 5. AI-Optimized Field Access

- **Quick Lookups:**
  - `activeContext`: Whatâ€™s being worked on now?
  - `knownIssues`: Whatâ€™s blocking progress?
  - `userExperienceGoals`: What matters most to users?
  - `patterns.implementation`: Whatâ€™s the best way to solve this?
- **Indexing:** Consider indexing high-access fields for fast retrieval.
- **Digest Generation:** Use AI to generate short, context-window-friendly summaries for each field.
