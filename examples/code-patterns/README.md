# Code Pattern Examples

This directory contains code patterns and examples that are referenced in PRP templates and used by the MongoDB Context Engineering Platform for pattern discovery and implementation guidance.

## 🎯 Purpose

These examples serve as:
- **Reference patterns** for AI assistants during implementation
- **Template code** for common functionality
- **Best practices** demonstrations
- **Pattern recognition** training data for MongoDB intelligence

## 📁 Structure

```
examples/code-patterns/
├── authentication/          # User authentication patterns
├── api-design/             # RESTful API patterns
├── database/               # Database interaction patterns
├── testing/                # Testing strategies and patterns
├── error-handling/         # Error handling patterns
├── security/               # Security implementation patterns
└── performance/            # Performance optimization patterns
```

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **PRP Generation**: When generating PRPs, the system references these patterns
2. **Pattern Discovery**: MongoDB vector search finds similar patterns
3. **AI Guidance**: AI assistants use these as implementation examples
4. **Continuous Learning**: Successful implementations are added back to the knowledge base

## 🔄 Integration with MongoDB

These patterns are:
- **Indexed** in MongoDB with vector embeddings
- **Searchable** via semantic similarity
- **Ranked** by success rates and usage
- **Enhanced** with metadata and context

## 📝 Contributing Patterns

To add new patterns:
1. Create pattern files in appropriate subdirectories
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Add success metrics and usage examples
4. Run `mcp-context-engineering generate-sample-data` to index new patterns

## Adding Your Own Patterns

To contribute your successful patterns:

1. Create a new markdown file following the naming convention
2. Use the template structure shown in examples
3. Include real metrics and gotchas from your experience
4. Submit a pull request with your pattern

Your patterns will automatically be available to the community through the MongoDB Context Engineering platform!
