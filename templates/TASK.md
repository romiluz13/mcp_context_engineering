### Pattern Contributions
*Successful implementations to contribute back*

- [ ] **Document Pattern: [Pattern Name]** - Successful implementation pattern
  - Success metrics to record
  - Gotchas to document
  - Best practices to share

## üìù Task Management Guidelines

### Task Creation
- **Be specific** - Clear, actionable descriptions
- **Include acceptance criteria** - What defines "done"
- **Estimate effort** - Small (< 2 hours), Medium (2-8 hours), Large (> 8 hours)
- **Note dependencies** - What must be done first

### Task Updates
- **Update progress regularly** - Keep status current
- **Document blockers** - Note what's preventing progress
- **Record discoveries** - Add new tasks found during work
- **Mark completion** - Move to completed section with date

### Priority Management
- **High Priority** - Critical for current sprint/milestone
- **Medium Priority** - Important but can wait
- **Low Priority** - Nice to have, future consideration

### Integration with AI Assistants
- **Reference this file** - AI assistants should check before starting work
- **Update after completion** - Mark tasks done immediately
- **Add discovered tasks** - Include new tasks found during implementation
- **Use with MongoDB Context Engineering** - Tasks inform PRP generation
